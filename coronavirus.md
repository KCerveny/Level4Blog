# Coming Changes of Corona Virus
> 3/21/2020

Today, I am sitting at home, secluded from the rest of the world during my spring break. UT has decided that spring break be extended by a week,
originally to have time to prepare for the impending virus. However, shortly after spring break was extended, it was announced that all of 
our classes were to be transfered online for the remainder of the semester.
